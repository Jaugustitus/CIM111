  <div id="introinfo"><p><b>About Me<b><br> My name is Jeremy Augustitus. I am currently a sophomore enrolled at the Univeristy of Miami. I am twenty years old and I have one older brother named Aron. He is twenty-two and just graduated from Michigan State University.<br>
<b>Life</b><br>
I grew up in North Caldwell, a small town in Northern New Jersey about 20-30 minutes from New York City. Growing up I played a variety of sports, like most kids, but the two sports I stuck with, until i graduated, were ice hockey and skiing. I started skating when I was three years old and started skiing around the age of five. I played competive hockey until my senior year of high school and now I play in mens leauges. I still ski as much as I can. Currently I am a Public Relations major at the University of Miami. I would like to work in the music, fashion, or sports industry. Starting the first semester of my junior year, I will be studying abroad in Rome,Italy.<br>
<b>Website</b><br>
The purpose of this website is that it is a portfolio of some of the work that I have done throughout my time in college. The website will contain my resume, work from my web design class, and then two projects from my graphic design classes</p>
